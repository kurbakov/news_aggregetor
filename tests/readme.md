This the directory for tests.  
For each class we need the test.

Currently the following classes required tests:
- BACKEND DATABASE: project_a/backend/classes/class_database.py
- BACKEND PARSER: project_a/backend/classes/class_parser.py
- BACKEND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS: project_a/backend/classes/class_sentiment_analysis.py
- BACKEND TWITTER: project_a/backend/classes/class_twitter.py
- API /GET: project_a/api/scr/__init__.py

As the tool for the tests we use unittest (Unit testing framework).

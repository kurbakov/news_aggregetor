This the directory for tests.  
For each class we need the test.

Currently the following classes required tests:
- [BACKEND DATABASE](https://github.com/kurbakov/project_a/tree/master/backend/classes/class_database.py)
- [BACKEND PARSER](https://github.com/kurbakov/project_a/tree/master/backend/classes/class_parser.py)
- [BACKEND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS](https://github.com/kurbakov/project_a/tree/master/backend/classes/class_sentiment_analysis.py)
- [BACKEND TWITTER](https://github.com/kurbakov/project_a/tree/master/backend/classes/class_twitter.py)
- [API /GET](https://github.com/kurbakov/project_a/blob/master/api/scr/__init__.py)

As the tool for the tests we use unittest (Unit testing framework).

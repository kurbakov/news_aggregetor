### This the directory for tests  

For each class we need the test.

Currently the following classes required tests:
- [BACKEND DATABASE](https://github.com/kurbakov/project_a/tree/master/backend/classes/class_database.py)
- [BACKEND PARSER](https://github.com/kurbakov/project_a/tree/master/backend/classes/class_parser.py)
- [BACKEND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS](https://github.com/kurbakov/project_a/tree/master/backend/classes/class_sentiment_analysis.py)
- [BACKEND TWITTER](https://github.com/kurbakov/project_a/tree/master/backend/classes/class_twitter.py)
- [API /GET](https://github.com/kurbakov/project_a/blob/master/api/scr/__init__.py)

As the tool for the tests we use unittest (Unit testing framework).  
For more information please visit the official webpage: [link](https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html)

### How to add/modify tests

All tests are stored in [project_a/tests/all_tests_files/](https://github.com/kurbakov/project_a/tree/master/tests/all_tests_files).
You can find already a small example of the test. Just modify or add new files to this directory.

To run tests please execute the file run_all_tests.py

Have fun!

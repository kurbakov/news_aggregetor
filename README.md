# project_a

Welcome to the __project_a__ GitHub repository!

The aim of this project is to build the news aggregator. We are guided by some simple rules: have some fun with the code, learn something new in the free time, and of course make the world a better place! =)

## Motivation

Nowadays, every single second we receive a massive amount of information about things happening in the world from the internet. Unsurprisingly, it is very easy to get lost in the flow. Usually, each of us has a couple of favourite sites out there, which we get 90% of the news from. Unfortunately, every newspaper follows interests of a small groups of people, and are held privately. Thus, news have become a tradable good. Eventually, newspaper generate the information for selling.

The idea of this project is to gather the information from all possible free independent sources all over the world, do analysis on it, and compare alternatives, in order to understand the truth.

As an example of the mass media news manipulation just check the president election in the USA of 2016, MH17 investigation in EU, or Brexit.

## Who can join

It is open source project so anyone can join and contribute. All ideas, or code improvements will be reviewed. If you see that we can do something better just text me!

## What is the current status of the project

Currently, I am trying to finilize the basic functionality of the backend. Next step will be start working on the frontend, and create white pages for the frontend.

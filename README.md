# project_a

Welcome to the __project_a__ GitHub repository!

This is a project to build the news generator. The main goal of the project is to have fun with the code, learn something new in my free time and first od all make the world better! =)

## Motivation

Currently we and different types of bots generate a massive volume of the information in the internet every signle second. So it is very easy to get lost in the internet. That is why each of us has 1-2 favourite data sources in the internet where we get 90% of the information about news in the world. But nowadays every newspaper is private and basically they sell news to consumers. So the newspaper generate the information for sell. 

The idea of the current project is to collect the information from all over the world and compare it to each other so we can clarify who is lying and what is the reason. 

As an example of the mass media news manipulation just check the president election in the USA, MH17 investigation in EU or Brexit.

## Who can join

It is open source project so everyone can join and contribute to the project. It can be an idea or improvement in the code. If you see that we can do something better just text me!

## What is the current status of the project

Currently I am trying to finilize the basic functionality of the backend. Next step will be start working on the frontend and create white pages for the frontend.
